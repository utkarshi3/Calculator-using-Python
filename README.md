# Basic Calculator in Python (Tkinter)

This project is a graphical calculator application built using Python's **Tkinter** library. The calculator offers a user-friendly interface with essential mathematical operations, making it a handy tool for quick calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Advanced Functions**: Percentage, Square (`x^2`), Reciprocal (`1/x`).
- **Parentheses Support**: Perform complex calculations with proper order of operations.
- **Backspace Functionality**: Remove the last entered character.
- **Clear Button**: Reset the input field to start a new calculation.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to be easy to use and visually appealing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for the application logic.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit for building the graphical interface.
